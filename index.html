    <div class="explanation">
        <p>I’ve always been fascinated by how people experience time. I see <mark>“out of order” not as a mistake</mark>, but as something essential to how we truly feel and live. When time escapes measurement, it becomes something we sense. Think about how time <mark>stretches during sadness</mark>, <mark>compresses during joy</mark>, or <mark>disappears during deep focus</mark>. It moves differently depending on what we feel.</p>

        <p>To me, time isn't just a linear sequence. It is <mark>emotional</mark>, <mark>contextual</mark>, and <mark>deeply personal</mark>. I'm drawn to the idea that everyone experiences time differently. Some people live their entire lives without needing to define time through numbers. And maybe that isn't just possible, but more human.</p>
        
        <p>This small interaction prototype explores a way to experience time through <mark>presence rather than precision</mark>. Instead of numerical input, users provide a moment: how they feel, where they are, what surrounds them. <mark>Emotion, memory, and place</mark> become the raw material. Using <mark>generative AI</mark>, these inputs are translated into <mark>unexpected expressions</mark>. It could be sounds, visuals, rhythms, or even interactive patterns. Each output is a <mark>reflection of that moment’s feeling</mark>, uniquely shaped and impossible to repeat. Each user will receive a different outcome, because no two perceptions of time are ever the same. The system acknowledges this. Time becomes personal and nonlinear. It becomes fluid and layered. It becomes <mark>“out of order”</mark>. That chaos is not a flaw. <mark>It is where meaning lives</mark>.</p>
        
        <p>I often think about pets. Their lifespans unfold differently than ours. Their time feels out of sync with our own, yet we still share the same moments. <mark>Different species, different rhythms, same presence</mark>. It's a reminder: <mark>time doesn’t need to align to be beautiful</mark>.</p>
        
        <p>In the end, I want this small interaction to create a pause for users. A moment where the user <mark>realizes their own existence</mark> and <mark>feels appreciation for being alive</mark>. Time becomes not something to track, but something to feel. <mark>GenAI becomes a co-creator</mark> in that moment, reshaping experience not through logic, but through <mark>emotion</mark>.</p>
