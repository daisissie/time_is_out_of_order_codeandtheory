      <p>I've always been fascinated by how people experience time. I see "out of order" not as a mistake, but as something essential to how we truly feel and live. When time escapes measurement, it becomes something we sense. Think about how time stretches during grief, compresses during joy, or disappears during deep focus. It moves differently depending on what we feel.</p>
      <p>To me, time isn't just a linear sequence. It is emotional, contextual, and deeply personal. I'm drawn to the idea that everyone experiences time differently. Some people live their entire lives without needing to define time through numbers. And maybe that isn't just possible, but more human.</p>
      <p>This project explores a way to experience time through interaction. I want to design a system where time is shaped by emotion, memory, location, and perception. Instead of numbers, the inputs are how the user feels, where they are, and how they exist in that moment. With generative AI, these inputs can be transformed into a sound, a visual, or a simple shift in experience. The result might be a graph, a rhythm, a mood, or something unexpected.</p>
      <p>Each user will receive a different outcome, because no two perceptions of time are ever the same. The system acknowledges this. Time becomes personal and nonlinear. It becomes fluid and layered. It becomes out of order. That chaos is not a flaw. It is where meaning lives.</p>
      <p>I think of pets. Their lifespans move differently than ours. Their time feels out of sync. Yet we share the same moments. Different species, different rhythms, same presence. That is a reminder: time doesn't need to align in order to be beautiful.</p>
      <p>In the end, I want this small interaction to create a pause. A moment where the user realizes their own existence and feels appreciation for being alive.</p>
